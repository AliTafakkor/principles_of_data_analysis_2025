# 🧠 Principles of Data Analysis – SWS 2025

Welcome to the companion repository for the **"Principles of Data Analysis"** talk, delivered as part of the **Summer Workshop Series 2025**.

This repo contains:
- 📽️ The presentation slides (`.pptx`)
- 📊 Code demos (e.g., p-value simulations, multiple comparisons)
- 📚 Links to further reading and resources

## 🎯 What This Talk Is About

This is not a textbook lecture.

Instead, it's a **collection of insights, reminders, and practical tips** I wish I'd internalized earlier in my research career. The themes are:
- Making sense of **signal vs. noise**
- Being honest about the **limits of our data**
- Thinking through the **data lifecycle**
- Avoiding common traps like **p-hacking** and **overfitting**
- And most importantly: doing science that's **ethical, transparent, and reproducible**

The advice is scattered by design — think of it as a toolkit, not a rulebook.

## 🧪 Running the Demos

The code snippets are written in Python and runnable in:
- Google Colab (recommended for quick setup)
- Jupyter notebooks (if you have Python 3.8+ and packages like NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Each demo is self-contained with descriptions within the file.

_“Garbage in, garbage out” — but with a good README, at least it’s reusable garbage._
